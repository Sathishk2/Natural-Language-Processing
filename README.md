Hi

Thanks for visiting my natural language processing respository. 

I learn how to use the NLTK package from realpython.com
Through this tutorial, I learned how to 
1. find text to analyze.
2. preprocess my text for analysis
3. analyze my text
4. create visualizations based on my analysis.
There are many steps including tokenizing, filtering stop words, stemming, tagging parts of speech, lemmatizing, chunking, chinking, named entity recognition, concordance, dispersion plot, frequency distribution, and collocations. 

I also learn how to use RNN for identifying if a statement is positive or negative with the keras IMDB dataset. This is from freecodecamp.com
