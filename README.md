Hi

Thanks for visiting my natural language processing respository. 

In this repository, I learn how to use

1. NLTK package by tokenizing, filtering stop words, stemming, tagging parts of speech, lemmatizing, chunking, chinking, named entity recognition, concordance, dispersion plot, frequency distribution, and collocations.
2. using RNN for identifying if a statement is positive or negative with the keras IMDB dataset.
3. predicting hate speech using NLTK and Linguistic Inquiry & Word Count software.
4. word2vec
5. dependency distance
6. BERT

Datasets are from realpython, freecodecamp & Kaggle.
