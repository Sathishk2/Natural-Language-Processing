Hi

Thanks for visiting my natural language processing respository. 

In this repository, I learn how to use the NLTK package by

1. tokenizing, filtering stop words, stemming, tagging parts of speech, lemmatizing, chunking, chinking, named entity recognition, concordance, dispersion plot, frequency distribution, and collocations.
2. using RNN for identifying if a statement is positive or negative with the keras IMDB dataset.
3. predicting hate speech using Linguistic Inquiry & Word Count software. 

Datasets are from realpython, freecodecamp & Kaggle.
