Hi

Thanks for visiting my natural language processing with Python NLTK Package respository. 

In this repository, I learn how to use the NLTK package from  https://realpython.com/nltk-nlp-python/#getting-started-with-pythons-nltk

Through this tutorial, I learned how to 
1. find text to analyze.
2. preprocess my text for analysis
3. analyze my text
4. create visualizations based on my analysis.

There are many steps including tokenizing, filtering stop words, stemming, tagging parts of speech, lemmatizing, chunking, chinking, named entity recognition, concordance, dispersion plot, frequency distribution, and collocations.
