Hi
Thanks for visiting my natural language processing with Python NLTK Package respository. 
In this repository, I learn how to use the NLTK package from  https://realpython.com/nltk-nlp-python/#getting-started-with-pythons-nltk

Through this tutorial, I learned how to 
1. find text to analyze.
2. preprocess my text for analysis
3. analyze my text
4. create visualizations based on my analysis.

Thanks for coming!
